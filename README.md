WaveStack is my playground for building tools that make a creator’s life easier.  
Think of it as a **creator automation stack** — part AI, part workflow engine, part fun experiments.  

Instead of juggling dozens of apps, bots, and manual tasks, WaveStack brings them into one stack you can actually run yourself.  

---

## ✨ What It Does  

- 🎬 **Auto‑clipping highlights**  
  Never miss a good stream moment again.  

- 🤖 **Discord bot + automations**  
  Keep your community engaged, moderate chats, and share highlights automatically.  

- 🧩 **Workflow engine (n8n)**  
  Plug into Twitch, YouTube, Twitter/X, and other platforms with drag‑and‑drop logic.  

- 🎨 **Art & branding generator**  
  Make banners, overlays, thumbnails, or channel art on the fly.  

- 🖥 **Creator hub pages**  
  Showcase clips, highlights, and links on a personal page.  

- ⚡ **Ops & integrations**  
  Hooks into the same tools creators and teams already use.  

- ☁️ **Flexible storage**  
  Save clips locally or push them to S3, Google Drive, or OneDrive.

## 🚀 Why WaveStack?  

Because being a creator is already stressful enough.  
This stack is here to offload the repetitive stuff so you can focus on what actually matters: **creating**.  

---

## 🛠 Roadmap  

- ✅ Core API & Clipper service  
- ✅ n8n workflow engine  
- 🚧 Discord bot for creators & communities  
- 🚧 Uploader service (S3/Drive/OneDrive)  
- 🚧 Stream & brand art generator  
- 🌐 Public hosted version (coming later)  

---

## 👀 Who’s It For?  

- **🎥 Streamers** → automated highlights, overlays, and Discord bot magic.  
- **👥 Communities** → workflows and bots that keep things running smoothly.  
- **👩‍💻 Developers** → modular services, open APIs, and full self‑hosting.  

---

## 📖 Docs & Setup  

If you want to run WaveStack locally, head over to the [**/docs**](./docs) folder.  
Everything you need to get started (with Docker, configs, and services) lives there.
